# Final Project Report: FPGA-Accelerated Transformer Implementation

## Implementation

### System Architecture

This project implements a complete encoder-decoder transformer optimized for FPGA acceleration. The system consists of four main components: the transformer neural network, FPGA acceleration layer with SystemVerilog modules, performance monitoring framework, and training infrastructure. The design maximizes computational intensity within a 50,000 parameter constraint while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer architectures.

### Transformer Architecture

The implementation follows the "Attention Is All You Need" architecture with optimizations for FPGA deployment:

**Model Specifications:**
- **Total Parameters**: 43,134 (86% of 50k budget)
- **Architecture**: 6 encoder + 6 decoder layers
- **Attention**: 4 heads per layer, d_model=16 (d_k=d_v=4 per head)
- **Sequence Length**: 1024 tokens for ultra-long sequences
- **Vocabulary**: 350 tokens (both source/target)
- **Feed-Forward**: 16-dimensional hidden layers
- **Regularization**: Dropout (p=0.1) throughout

The model uses pre-norm layer normalization, residual connections, and sinusoidal positional encoding. Parameter allocation: 38.9% for embeddings, 61.1% for transformer architecture, optimized through systematic analysis.

### FPGA Integration

The system uses Intel DE10-Lite (Cyclone V FPGA, 85K logic elements) operating at 100MHz. Six SystemVerilog modules implement matrix multiplication acceleration:

1. **`de10_lite_top.sv`**: Top-level module with clock distribution and I/O management
2. **`matrix_multiplier.sv`**: Systolic array for parallel matrix operations
3. **`uart_controller.sv`**: 115.2 kbaud communication interface
4. **`host_interface.sv`**: Command parsing and data flow management
5. **`pll_100mhz.sv`**: Clock generation from 50MHz input
6. **`testbench.sv`**: Verification environment with automated testing

The `K5FPGAAccelerator` Python class provides seamless CPU-FPGA communication with automatic fallback to CPU execution when needed.

### Performance Optimization

Systematic exploration of the parameter space optimized five dimensions: vocabulary size, d_model, sequence length, layer depth, and attention heads. Key findings:

- Vocabulary size 300-400 tokens optimizes parameter allocation
- d_model=16 balances efficiency and representational capacity  
- 1024-token sequences maximize computational intensity through quadratic attention scaling
- 6 layers provide optimal depth within parameter constraints

FPGA acceleration targets matrix multiplications in attention mechanisms, using hybrid execution where embeddings and normalization remain on CPU while intensive matrix operations are offloaded to FPGA.

### Data Pipeline and Training

The system uses Helsinki-NLP Opus-100 dataset for English-Hebrew translation with automatic download, caching, and subset selection. WordLevel tokenization with 350-token vocabularies includes unknown token handling and special token management.

Training features include epoch-by-epoch cycle analysis, automatic checkpointing, TensorBoard logging, and real-time performance monitoring. Loss computation uses cross-entropy with label smoothing (Î±=0.1), Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling, and automatic best-model selection.
