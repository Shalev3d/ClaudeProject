## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Start FPGA Server (On K5 System)
```bash
launch_k5_app de10_lite_matrix_multiplier -ccd1 XON
```

The C program:
- Initializes K5 and FPGA board (same as proven 4x4 example)
- Creates `fpga_server_ready.txt` signal file
- Starts monitoring for matrix requests
- Measures total training cycles from start to finish

### Step 2: Start Python Training (Local Machine)  
```bash
python3 train.py  # with use_fpga=True
```

Python training:
- Waits for `fpga_server_ready.txt` signal
- Runs normal transformer training
- For each `torch.matmul()`, sends matrix to C program via files
- Waits for FPGA result and continues training
- Creates `python_training_complete.txt` when done

### Step 3: File-Based Communication

**Matrix Request (Python → C):**
- `fpga_matrix_request_N_config.txt` (dimensions)
- `fpga_matrix_request_N_data_a.txt` (matrix A data)
- `fpga_matrix_request_N_data_b.txt` (matrix B data)

**Result Response (C → Python):**
- `fpga_matrix_request_N_result.txt` (result matrix)

## 📊 Expected Results

When you run this integration, you'll get:

### From C Program (K5 Server):
```
🚀 FPGA-ACCELERATED TRANSFORMER TRAINING CONTROLLER
✅ FPGA server ready - Python can now send matrix requests
📋 Processing matrix request #0
🚀 Processing 4x4 @ 4x4 on FPGA
✅ FPGA operation completed in 78193208 cycles
📋 Processing matrix request #1
...
🏆 FPGA server processed 847 matrix operations
🏆 Total training cycles with FPGA acceleration: 1,234,567,890
```

### From Python Training (Local Machine):
```
✅ FPGA server is ready - Python can now send matrix requests
📡 Sent matrix torch.Size([4, 4]) @ torch.Size([4, 4]) request #0 to C program
✅ Received FPGA result for request #0 from C program
...
🚀 K5 FPGA Performance Summary:
   • FPGA operations: 847
   • FPGA usage ratio: 85.2%
   • Real FPGA cycles: 66,185,627,276
📄 Signaled training completion to FPGA server
```

## 🔍 Comparison with CPU Training

| Metric | **CPU Training** | **FPGA Training** | **Expected** |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Total cycles** | 1.68 trillion | ??? (measured) | Lower |
| **Matrix ops** | All on CPU | Mix of FPGA + CPU | Accelerated |
| **Cycle source** | Estimated | Real K5 hardware | Accurate |
| **Architecture** | Pure Python | C + FPGA + Python | Hybrid |

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### On K5 Server:
1. **Compile** (if needed):
   ```bash
   launch_k5_app de10_lite_matrix_multiplier -ccd1 XON
   ```

2. **Run FPGA server**:
   ```bash
   launch_k5_app de10_lite_matrix_multiplier -ccd1 XON
   ```
   
   Wait for: `✅ FPGA server ready - Python can now send matrix requests`

### On Local Machine:
3. **Start Python training**:
   ```bash
   python3 train.py
   ```
   
   The training will automatically:
   - Wait for FPGA server
   - Send matrix operations to FPGA
   - Complete with real cycle measurements

## 📈 What This Achieves

✅ **Real FPGA acceleration** of transformer training matrix operations
✅ **Actual K5 cycle measurements** from hardware (not estimates)  
✅ **Same proven architecture** as your working 4x4 matrix multiplication
✅ **Complete integration** between Python ML training and FPGA acceleration
✅ **Cycle comparison** between CPU-only and FPGA-accelerated training

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

You should see **significantly different cycle counts** between:
- **CPU training**: 1.68 trillion cycles (estimated)
- **FPGA training**: ??? cycles (real hardware measurements)

This will give you the **exact performance comparison** you wanted between CPU and FPGA approaches for transformer training!
