Test the complete FPGA workflow architecture
Simulates how the C program calls Python and they communicate via files

This tests the same architecture as the 4x4 matrix multiplication:
1. C program is main controller 
2. C program calls Python scripts
3. Communication via files
4. C program handles FPGA operations
5. Real cycle measurements from C program
